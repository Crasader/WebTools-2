# WebTools

**WebTools** is an *open-source* comprehensive collection of useful tools written in PHP and JavaScript.
Currently it includes:

- A tool to show your IP address information
- A URL to IP converter tool
- A PharTools based PHP-archive extractor (*.phar) tool
- A simple password generator
- A more advanced password generator
- A powerful unit converter tool

Other tools will be added later. Adding tools is very easy thanks to the simple API included in WebTools allowing the creation of new tools/scripts without modifying the WebTools core source code.
